====== Conventions ======

===== Github =====

==== Branch Naming ====

=== Basic Rules === 

  - Lowercase and Hyphen-separated: Stick to lowercase for branch names and use hyphens to separate words. For instance, feature/new-login or bugfix/header-styling.
  - Alphanumeric Characters: Use only alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0–9) and hyphens. Avoid punctuation, spaces, underscores, or any non-alphanumeric character.
  - No Continuous Hyphens: Do not use continuous hyphens. feature--new-login can be confusing and hard to read.
  - No Trailing Hyphens: Do not end your branch name with a hyphen. For example, feature-new-login- is not a good practice.
  - Descriptive: The name should be descriptive and concise, ideally reflecting the work done on the branch.

=== Branch Prefixes ===

  - Feature Branches: These branches are used for developing new features. Use the prefix feature/. For instance, feature/login-system.
  - Bugfix Branches: These branches are used to fix bugs in the code. Use the prefix bugfix/. For example, bugfix/header-styling.
  - Hotfix Branches: These branches are made directly from the production branch to fix critical bugs in the production environment. Use the prefix hotfix/. For instance, hotfix/critical-security-issue.
  - Release Branches: These branches are used to prepare for a new production release. They allow for last-minute dotting of i’s and crossing t’s. Use the prefix release/. For example, release/v1.0.1.

==== Pull Request Conventions ====

=== Title ===

  - For a single commit, the title is the subject line of the commit message.
  - Otherwise, the title should summarize the set of commits.

=== Description ===

  - Must state the why and the how for the change.
    - Usually this is the body of your commit message.
  - Must explain the purpose of the PR, e.g.:
    - feedback for an initial implementation,
    - request for comment,
    - ready to merge.
  - Explain any context:
    - is it part of a greater set of changes?
    - are any concurrent PRs (in other repositories) dependent on this PR?
