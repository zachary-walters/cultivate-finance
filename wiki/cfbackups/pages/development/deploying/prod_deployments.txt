====== Deploying for Production ====== 

===== Civo =====

We use [[https://www.civo.com|Civo]] for our production kubernetes hosting. We do this because their pricing is/was the most competitive at the time of development. As the project scales up, our host is subject to change.

==== Preliminary Setup ====

  - Please follow these instructions to setup a civo environment locally: [[development:deploying:prod_deployments:civo_environment_setup|Setup Civo Environment]]
  - After your Civo Kubernetes environment is setup, we can secure our kubernetes services with SSL with this process: [[development:deploying:prod_deployments:SSL Setup]]

==== Deploying Ingress ====

By default, Civo uses [[https://traefik.io/traefik/|Traefik]] as the proxy into our cluster. Our Ingress serves as the main entrypoint to our application. 

=== Deploying Staging Ingress ===

We use a staging ingress that uses staging based TLS keys. These keys are, for all intents and purposes, useless outside of testing.

You can deploy the ingress using the following:

  - Confirm you are in the build directory: <code bash>cd build</code>
  - You can deploy using EITHER the make command OR kubectl
    - make command: <code bash>make k_deploy_ingress_staging</code>
    - kubectl: <code bash>kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress-traefik-staging.yml</code>


=== Deploying Production Ingress ===

You can deploy the ingress using the following:

  - Confirm you are in the build directory: <code bash>cd build</code>
  - You can deploy using EITHER the make command OR kubectl
    - make command: <code bash>make k_deploy_ingress_prod</code>
    - kubectl: <code bash>kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress-traefik-prod.yml</code>


Confirm your ingress is up and running: <code bash>
kubectl get ing
## Confirm you see 3 entries
# 1. cultivate-finance-base-ingress
# 2. cultivate-finance-ingress-www
# 3. cultivate-finance-ingress-base-dns
</code>

==== Deploying the Web Application ====

You can find guide for deploying our web application to our kubernetes cluser here: [[development:webapp:webapp#building_and_running_the_webapp_in_kubernetes_production|Building and Running the Webapp in Kubernetes production]]
