====== Civo Environment Setup ======

===== Civo CLI ===== 

Civo has their own [[https://www.civo.com/docs/overview/civo-cli|cli tool]] that can be used to interact with their hosting products. You can install it by running the following (macOS): 

<code bash>
brew tap civo/tools
brew install civo
</code>

You need to obtain your api key from the civo dashboard:

Once you have your api key in hand, you can connect the civo cli with the following steps:

  - Run the following command: <code bash>civo apikey save</code>
  - When prompted to "Enter a nice name for this account/API Key", enter: <code>cultivate-finance</code>
  - When prompted to "Enter the API key", enter the your Civo API key obtained from previous steps.

Once your API key is set, you can run civo commands to interact with your cluster. 

===== Creating a new cluster =====

We can use the following command to create a new kubernetes cluster: <code bash>
set -k 

# delete cluster if exists
civo kubernetes delete cultivate-finance

# create the new cluster
civo kubernetes create cultivate-finance -n 1 -s g4s.kube.medium --cluster-type k3s --create-firewall --firewall-rules "6443" --region NYC1 --wait --save --merge --switch --create-firewall --firewall-rules '80;443;6443'
</code>




You can download your civo kubernetes cluster config with the following command: 
<code bash>civo kubernetes config cultivate-finance --save</code>

Confirm you can see stats from your civo kubernetes cluster with the following command:

<code bash>civo kubernetes show cultivate-finance</code>

===== Setting up the network to your cluster =====

  - Obtain the DNS Record for the cluster by running the following command: <code bash>civo kubernetes show cultivate-finance -o custom -f "DNSEntry"</code>
  - Under the CIVO web panel, navigate to Networking -> DNS
  - Under cultivatefinance.org, click Actions -> DNS Records
  - Click Add Record
  - Select CNAME
  - Under Name use ''%%cultivatefinance.org%%''
  - Under Value use the DNS record given from step 2
  - Set TTL to 3600
  - Click Add Record
  - Select CNAME
  - Under Name use ''%%www.cultivatefinance.org%%''
  - Under Value use the DNS record given from step 2
  - Set TTL to 3600

===== Install the necessary applications to the cluster =====

We use Kubernetes Dashboard for monitoring and Cert Manager for managing our TLS certificates. You can install both of them by running the following: <code bash>
civo kubernetes applications add kubernetes-dashboard --cluster cultivate-finance
civo kubernetes applications add cert-manager --cluster cultivate-finance</code>

===== Monitoring with Kubernetes Dashboard =====

Generate an admin user token by running the following:
<code bash> 
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard create token admin-user
</code>

Once you have your token, you can proxy into the control plane with the following command: 
<code bash>kubectl proxy</code>

Then browse the dashboard at: 

http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/#/login
