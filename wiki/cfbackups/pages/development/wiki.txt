====== Wiki ======

This wiki is our main source of documentation. 

===== Intricacies =====

  * [[https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki|Dokuwiki]]: We use Dokuwiki for a number of reasons:
    * No Database: There is less involved in maintenance tasks, such as backing up/restoring
    * Plain Text Datafiles: Datafiles are stored in plain text, making them easy to back up, read, modify, compare, generate with external (non-wiki) programs, and move from one DokuWiki-installation to another.
    * Simple and Consistent 
  * Local vs Production
    * Our local builds are editable
      * Username for local: admin
      * Password for local: admin
    * Our production builds remove login functionality, so the world-facing wiki cannot actually be edited

===== Local Deploy =====

  - Confirm you are in the build directory:<code bash>cd build</code>
  - Deploy the wiki locally by running the following make command:<code bash>make wiki</code>
  - Go to localhost and confirm the wiki is up: http://localhost:8181

==== Handling Container Crashes on ARM Macs ====

Our dockerfile specifies linux/amd64 as the container platform. Some mac's have issues running this in Docker. In the case your wiki container keeps crashing, follow these supplemental steps:

  - Confirm you are in the build directory:<code bash>cd build</code>
  - Confirm you have deleted the wiki container that is crashing
  - Deploy the wiki locally by running the following make command:<code bash>make wiki_arm</code>
  - Go to localhost and confirm the wiki is up: http://localhost:8181


==== Restoring ====

Once the wiki is deployed, we need to restore the contents of our versioned wiki.

  - Confirm you are in the build directory:<code bash>cd build</code>
  - Run the make command: <code bash>make restore_wiki</code>
  - Confirm the wiki is restored by going to http://localhost:8181

===== Production Deploy =====

  - Confirm you are in the build directory:<code bash>cd build</code>
  - Build the docker container and push it the dockerhub repository: <code bash>make docker_push_wiki_prod</code>
  - Delete the current wiki pod and service in the kubernetes cluster: <code bash>kubectl delete -f k8s/wiki.yml</code>
  - Apply the new image to the kubernetes cluster: <code bash>kubectl apply -f k8s/wiki.yml</code>
  - Forward the port on the pod so we can check it is working: <code bash>kubectl port-forward service/wiki-service 8181:8181</code>
  - Confirm the wiki is restored by going to http://localhost:8181

=== Restoring === 

Restoring the state of the wiki in our production environment is a little more involved than in our development environment. We need to shell into the pod in the cluster and manually run some commands.

  - Shell into the pod: <code bash>kubectl exec -it deployment/wiki-service -n default -- bash</code>
  - Run the following commands: <code bash>
cp -r /cfbackups_prd/conf /bitnami/dokuwiki
cp -r /cfbackups_prd/pages /bitnami/dokuwiki/data
cp -r /cfbackups_prd/attic /bitnami/dokuwiki/data
cp -r /cfbackups_prd/meta /bitnami/dokuwiki/data
cp -r /cfbackups_prd/meta_attic /bitnami/dokuwiki/data
cp -r /cfbackups_prd/media /bitnami/dokuwiki/data
cp -r /cfbackups_prd/media_meta /bitnami/dokuwiki/data
cp -r /cfbackups_prd/media_attic /bitnami/dokuwiki/data

echo '' > /bitnami/dokuwiki/conf/users.auth.php
</code>
  - Port forward: <code bash>kubectl port-forward service/wiki-service 8181:8181</code>
  - Confirm the wiki now has data at http://localhost:8181

===== Making Updates to the Wiki =====

==== Updating ====

Updates to the wiki are only allowed to be made locally. The process for doing so is as follows:

  - Confirm you are in the build directory<code bash>cd build</code>
  - Deploy the wiki locally following these steps: [[development:wiki#local_deploy|Deploy Wiki Locally]]
  - Login using the username:password: ''%%admin:admin%%''
  - Make your changes

==== Versioning ====

The process for versioning updates to the wiki is as follows:

  - Confirm you are in the build directory<code bash>cd build</code>
  - Backup the changes you made by running the following: <code bash>
make backup_wiki
</code>
  - Commit your changes
